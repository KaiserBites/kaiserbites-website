      <p>
        Servus! We’re Max and Lena – two food-obsessed locals who believe that Vienna is best explored through your taste buds. Whether it's crispy Schnitzel, freshly baked Semmel, or a cheeky Spritzer, our tours are all about sharing the city’s culinary soul with curious eaters from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max studied physics but secretly always wanted to be a tour guide. Lena’s a trained pastry chef who can sniff out the best Topfenstrudel within a five-block radius. We started KaiserBites to offer the kind of food experience we’d want ourselves: warm, personal, full of fun facts, and above all – delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t just point at buildings and name-drop composers (although we do that too). We talk about what people actually eat, where locals shop, and how food ties into Vienna’s layered history. No stiff lectures – just good vibes, good eats, and hopefully, some new friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come hungry – and come curious.
