    <!-- Restaurants -->

          <h3>Amerlingbeisl</h3>
          <p>The Amerlingbeisl is tucked away in a 
            beautiful inner courtyard of a historic Biedermeier 
            house in the Spittelberg district. From the street, 
            you'd never guess that behind the entrance lies one 
            of Vienna's most idyllic Schanigärten (outdoor dining gardens), 
            full of greenery and old-world flair. It’s especially popular in summer.</p>

          <h3>Neubauschenke</h3>
          <p>The Neubauschenke is a cozy Viennese tavern that serves traditional home made Viennese dishes. Their infamous Apfelstrudel is freshly baked every day and is served warm from the oven.</p>

          <img src="images/leopold museum.jpg" alt="Uhrenmuseum">
          <h3>Leopold museum</h3>
          <p>The Leopold Museum houses one of the world’s most important collections 
            of Austrian modern art, featuring masterpieces by Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, 
            and the Wiener Werkstätte. Its clean, modern architecture contrasts beautifully 
            with the rich emotional depth of the art inside, making it a striking cultural experience. 
            Schiele fans will find intimate, raw, and often provocative works that offer deep insight 
            into Viennese expressionism and early 20th-century angst. Temporary exhibitions are often 
            bold and well-curated, drawing connections between past and present. Located in the heart 
            of the MuseumsQuartier, it’s a must-see for anyone wanting to understand Vienna’s artistic soul.</p>

          <h3>Belvedere</h3>
          <p>The Belvedere Museum offers not only world-class art but also stunning Baroque architecture 
            and gardens with panoramic views of Vienna. It’s home to Gustav Klimt’s "The Kiss", one of the 
            most iconic paintings in the world, alongside works by Schiele, Kokoschka, and French Impressionists. 
            The museum spans centuries of Austrian art history, from medieval altarpieces to contemporary installations. 
            Visiting the Belvedere is like stepping into a living piece of imperial and cultural history.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="images/frau mayer.jpg" alt="Der Späte Vogel">
          <h3>Frau Mayer</h3>
          <p>Frau Mayer offers a rare glimpse into Vienna’s alternative, artsy nightlife—far from the usual tourist bars. 
            It’s a place where you can experience authentic local culture, hear live music up close, and even join in if you feel like it. 
            If you want to meet Viennese creatives and enjoy a spontaneous, welcoming vibe, this is the perfect off-the-beaten-path spot.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="images/cafe schopenhauer.jpg" alt="Sissi Spritz">
          <h3>Café Schopenhauer</h3>
          <p>Café Schopenhauer is a cozy, intellectual-style Viennese café in the quiet 18th district, perfect for escaping the tourist buzz. 
            Named after the 19th-century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer—famous for his famously gloomy outlook on life—the café itself is anything but depressing. 
            With shelves full of books, old-school charm, friendly service, and a brunch menu that references great thinkers like Kant and Nietzsche, it feels like a warm hug for your brain. 
            It’s a great place to enjoy coffee, think deep thoughts (or none at all), and soak up a slice of real Vienna.
